            <h2>HTML and CSS are the building blocks of the web.</h2>
            <p>Currently I am focusing my efforts on the steps that are needed to become a successfull developer. I can't remember my first line of code all I remeber is the feeling I had when I wrote it. I felt invigorated, I had accomplished something that I had originally thought to be something that I needed a college degree to achieve.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is however a complete fabrication, I doctored up this hypothesis because I imagined that all coders were super smart, and brainy individuals that were out of my leauge, they like to do homework, and crunch numbers. I chuckle now when I think of the absurdity that line of thinking. True there are some coders that relish the numbers and all of them are in fact very smart, but that is not a requirement, and currently neither is a degree. Dont get me wrong I am not saying that you shouldn't get a degree on the contrary you totally should if its something you want. It is just not a requirement to enter the field that I have chosen to invest my time and effort in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>HTML and CSS are the basics and definitely the building blocks of the wed. I like to think of HTML and CSS as a house. HTML is the structure, and or wooden frame, the wiring all the things that make a house work. CSS is all of the siding, brick and things that make a house prettier. I have enjoyed my time studying HTML <strong>(Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> and CSS <strong>(Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> and I am looking forward to my journey into JavaScript. It may not be a building block but it is a powerful tool and akin to a beautiful remodeled kitchen. You already had a kitchen when you added CSS but JavaScript gives you added functions and tailors the "kitchen" to be more user friendly so to speak.</p>

                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and while it is the structure of most if not all websites it is not a programming language. It is actually a set of characters and symbols that when combined in a HTML document produce the text, images and links on a webpage. When typed out correctly a web browser gathers the data and you will see a bunch of writing and links though it won't be anything too fancy. Remember this is just the first part of the house, the structure.</p>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>I feel like this is where the fun truly begins, and though I like the Markup as it gets me too this point I really like the CSS as I have always loved design. CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets, and is used to make the site look more appealing to visitors. It allows you to add colors, fonts, and configure your layouts to so that things flow better for the visitor of your website.</p>

                <h3>JS</h3>
                <p>I have saved this for last because as of yet I haven't written a single line of JS code, I am following my plan which is to code one step at a time! I don't want to overwhelm myself. I am looking forward to making the leap into JS though and will update this post as soon as my journey allows.</p>
